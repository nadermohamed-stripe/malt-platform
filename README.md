This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

If you want to see the app in production: https://malt-platform.vercel.app/

## What is missing:

[] Add remaining balance in all pages
[] Add Factoring flow (?)
[] Add Money dialog to be fixed
[] Page with My balance + My Balance history + My payments
[] Project Transfer dialog + color automation
[] Connect /invoices to Stripe to show the pi
[] Send Money dialog to bulk pay all frelancers in /invoices
[] Terminal to show API Responses for devs
