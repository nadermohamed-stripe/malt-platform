This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

If you want to see the app in production: https://malt-platform.vercel.app/

## What is missing:

[] Create Stripe Account and real Connected Accounts for demo journey
[] Add Money dialog to be fixed
[] Fix /factoring send money success animation
[] API responses terminal done in loreal - to be added to all pages


WE NEED A STORY!!!! A PROJECT, A COMPELLING EVENT FOR FREELANCER AND CUSTOMER!!! 


- ONLY ONE USER ONBOARDING
- OTHER CONNECTED ACCOUNTS ALREADY READY
- CUSTOMER LOREAL NO AUTOMATIC RECONCILIATION
